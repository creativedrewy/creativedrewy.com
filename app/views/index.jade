              | On a final note, I realize it's not entirely clear how to actually pronounce 'WeaRSS' when you say it out loud. I'll try to lay the confusion to rest: the way I say it is "wear-R-ess-ess;" kind of in a flowing manner. I do pronounce both 'Wear' and 'RSS' but I mash them together a little bit with an extra "R" sound to bridge the two parts together.
